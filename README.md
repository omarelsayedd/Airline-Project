# Airline Project

This repository contains code and analysis related to the **Airline Project**. The project involves analyzing airline data to gain insights into various aspects such as flight delays, carrier performance, and airport statistics. The analysis leverages tools like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and other data science libraries to manipulate, visualize, and extract meaningful patterns from the dataset.

## Project Description

This project is aimed at analyzing airline data to identify trends and provide useful insights for better decision-making in the airline industry. It covers:
- Analysis of airline carriers and their performance.
- Breakdown of airport traffic and flight delays.
- Data visualization to highlight important statistics.
  
## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of airline datasets.
- Visual representation of flight delay trends over time.
- Analysis of the performance of different airline carriers and airports.
- Interactive charts to explore the data in detail.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `numpy`

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the notebook, open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Airline Project.ipynb
```

Within the notebook, you can follow along with the data cleaning, exploration, and visualization steps.

Example usage for analyzing specific flight delays:

```python
# Example: Visualizing delays by carrier
df['Delay'] = df['ArrDelay'].apply(lambda x: x if x > 0 else 0)
carrier_delay = df.groupby('Carrier')['Delay'].mean()
carrier_delay.plot(kind='bar')
```
